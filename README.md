Project 1 README:

Team:
Evan Lowell, ewl27

Known Issues:
None that Im aware of

Collaboration:
- I did this project solo as my member dropped the class unexpectedly 

Problems Faced:
- Properly decoding utf-8 and formatting the results.txt file

Usage: 

To run the server, use the following command:
python Server.py PORT, example: "python Server.py 5444"

where PORT is the port number to listen on.
To run the client, use the following command:
python Client.py SERVERADDRESS PORT, example: "python Client.py iLab4.cs.rutgers.edu 5444"

where SERVERADDRESS is the domain name or IP address of the server and PORT is the port number to connect to.
By default, the client reads from a file called source_strings.txt and writes to a file called results.txt.
